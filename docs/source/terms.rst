*Events* happen to objects. Events that can be listened to and used to hook into execution
of some algorithm are called *hooks*.

*To hook* into a hook, one registers *a hook handler*. Handlers can be associated with a context
explicitly, implicitly, or even be not associated with any context in which case they are called
whenever the event happens irrespective of who it happens to.
